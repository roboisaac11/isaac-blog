## Introduction
---
lol u just got **SCAMMED!** There actually is no introduction! All that is in the into section is these word you are reading right now, and I don't think you can call that an introduction!

Here's some things you can contemplate:
- [ ] Why am I reading this useless article?
- [ ] Why was this even created in the first place?
- [ ] How much more money should I be donating to Isaac?

Heres some output:
```bash
WARN  deprecated: site config key paginate was deprecated in Hugo v0.128.0 and will be removed in a future release. Use pagination.pagerSize instead.
WARN  Module "terminal" is not compatible with this Hugo version: Min 0.90.0 extended; run "hugo mod graph" for more information.

```

That was probably pretty useless for you, and same for me.

Welp, all good things must come to an end. I'm not sure if you would call this a good thing, but nonetheless it is still coming to an end.
